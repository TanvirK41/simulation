**Understand the properties of your analysis in repeated sampling.**

**Does statistic do what it's supposed to do?**


# Let's simulate:

I have a function 

```{r}
sim_mean_sd = function(samp_size, mu = 2, sigma = 3) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(samp_size, mean = mu, sd = sigma),
  )
  
  #returns 
  sim_data %>% 
    summarize(
      mu_hat = mean(x),
      sigma_hat = sd(x)
    )
}
```

I can "simulate" by running this line 

```{r}
sim_mean_sd(30)
```


# Let's simulate a lot

Let's start with a for loop.

```{r}

#100 times -> I have gone out in to the universe and asked the universe to give me a sample size 30, with a true mean 3 and true standard deviation 40, from a normal distribution 

output = vector("list", length = 100)

for (i in 1:100) {
  output[[i]] = sim_mean_sd(samp_size = 30)
}

bind_rows(output)
```
